## Tools Used
- Microsoft Azure
- Azure IAM, NSGs, and Logging
- Azure Security Center

## Objectives
- Configure and secure a cloud environment
- Implement IAM roles, network security groups, and logging
- Practice incident response workflows in a cloud setting

## Steps Taken
1. Deployed VMs and configured IAM roles in Azure
2. Set up Network Security Groups (NSGs) to restrict inbound/outbound traffic
3. Enabled logging and monitoring through Azure Monitor
4. Simulated a cloud attack scenario and analyzed logs
5. Documented incident response steps

## Sample Output
- `azure_nsg_config.png` (firewall rules screenshot)
- `incident_response_notes.txt` (workflow documentation)

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of IAM role separation
- Network segmentation in cloud environments
- Incident detection and response in Azure
